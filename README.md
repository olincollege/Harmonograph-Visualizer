# Harmonograph-Visualizer
Visualizing the line art produced by harmonographs.

## Introduction
My program simulates the output from a three pendulum rotary harmonograph
based on the user inputting the 3 frequencies with which the pedulums occilate.
More information about the physical system can be found here:
- [karlsims](https://www.karlsims.com/harmonograph/)

## Packages required:
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [math](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html)
- [random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html)

## How to Run The Program
Pull the files:
    -pendulum.py
    -plotting.py
    -controler.py
    -main_visualizer.ipynb
Open the main_visualizer file ina jupyter notebook and run the cells.  You
will be propted for imput and the plots will show below as well as saving as
svg files.
